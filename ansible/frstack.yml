# Install the ForgeRock stack
# This is a work in progress
#
# To run only a specific tag use the shellscript: bin/frstack tagname
#
# Before this is run it is assumed some basic pre-reqs have been completed:
#
# - The forgerock user has been created (default to fr). The software is installed using this account
#  The "fr" user must be created with become priv. The vagrant.yml does this for you
# - Appropriate Firewall ports must be open on the guest. We use haproxy to put most things through 80/443
# Right now this is very much dependent on Fedora/Centos packages, etc.  There is a start at making it
# Work on other platforms - but it needs work

# This play is needed to install python2 on fedora 23
